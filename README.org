* NAMD_BFEE2
The NAMD_BFEE2 repository includes input and configuration files to perform binding free energy
calculation simulations using the [[https://github.com/fhh2626/BFEE2/tree/main][BFEE2]] method for the 2WI3 system.
To install BFEE2, you can follow the steps below:

** Installation
*** First you need to install ~BFEE2~

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
conda create --name bfee2
conda activate bfee2
conda install -c conda-forge BFEE2
#+END_SRC

Note that you need to have conda installed on your system for these commands to work.

In addition to installing BFEE2, you also need to install NAMD and Gromacs and patch them with [[https://colvars.github.io][Colvars]] to run the simulations.
The [[https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41596-021-00676-1/MediaObjects/41596_2021_676_MOESM1_ESM.pdf][supplimentary Information]]
of the BFEE2 paper titled "Accurate determination of protein:ligand standard binding free energies from molecular dynamics simulations"
provides a detailed tutorial on how to install NAMD and Gromacs and patch them with Colvars.
